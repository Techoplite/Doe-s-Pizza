# Project Overview

This is a headless WordPress project with Next JS, meaning that the backend runs on the WordPress server whereas the frontend is served from Vercel. Please note that it is a Beta version, and that the full version should be available by the end of May 2022.

## Technologies involved
- Next JS 
- Sass 
- Redux
- GitHub
- Material UI
- Typescript
- WordPress
- Vercel
- Figma
- VS Code
- XAMP (development phase)


## Currently busy...
- Writing test with Cypress (I am learning this library now)

## Next to come
- Optimise landing page background loading (will have to make it a next/image element with priority set tu 'true' rather than using CSS)

## N.B.
At the current stage, the authentication process is nothing but some data saved in the Redux store, and will therefore persist only for the given session. In the future, this will make use of the WordPress authentication system, saving accounts and related data in the DB.
